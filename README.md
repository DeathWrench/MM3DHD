### Differences between Citra builds.
* The Citra Canary build follows the **power of 2 rule** which means you can only use textures that are 2x, 4x, 8x and 16x. Canary also supports subfolders vs loose files, so things can be organized better.
* The khang06 PR build does not abide by **power of 2** rule which means textures can be any resolution. This build is outdated though.

# Setup
* Download and install the Citra Canary build from Citra's website [here](https://citra-emu.org/download/)
### or
* Download and install the Citra PR build with custom texture support by [khang06](https://github.com/khang06) from [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/j53hpvmruwsl5jbf/artifacts/citra-windows-msvc-20190810-dacc1239.7z)
### It is best to make a folder called *user* inside the directory where the **citra-qt.exe** is located, and then run it once.  
#### 
That way the config files and what not get populated to the same folder as Citra and not in your Documents or AppData folder. (I forget which folder they go to by default specifically)
####
* After running Citra once, inside the directory: >user>load>textures>0004000000125***X***00
* USA = 0004000000125***5***00
* EUR = 0004000000125***6***00
* Place the textures you want from the ***MM3DHD.zip*** into this folder.
* Go into graphics options in Citra and make sure you have Use Custom Textures enabled. 
* Done

#### Information
There's a few textures that have different small edits to them, I am merging these changes and making variations of them. Splitting them up by folders, as people may like one style over the other. It's kind of unorganized at the moment. That will change in the future.
