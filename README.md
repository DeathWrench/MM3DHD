# MM3DHD
#### HD Majora's Mask 3D Textures
Download releasese [here](https://github.com/DeathWrench/MM3DHD/releases/)

# Setup
* Download and install the Citra PR build with custom texture support by khang06 from here:
#### https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/j53hpvmruwsl5jbf/artifacts/citra-windows-msvc-20190810-dacc1239.7z
* It is best to make a folder called **user** inside the directory where the **citra-qt.exe** is located, and then run it once.  
#### 
That way the config files and what not get installed to the same folder as Citra and not in your Documents or AppData folder. (I forget which folder they go to by default specifically)
* After running Citra once, inside the directory: >user>load>textures>0004000000125***X***00
####
USA = 0004000000125***5***00 
####
EUR = 0004000000125***6***00
* Place the textures from the .zip into this folder.
* Go into graphics options in Citra and make sure you have Use Custom Textures enabled. 
* Done

#### Information
There's a few textures that have different small edits to them, I am merging these changes and making variations of them. Splitting them up by folders, as people may like one style over the other.
