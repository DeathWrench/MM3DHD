#### Differences between Citra builds.
The khang06 PR build does not abide by **power of 2** rule which means textures can be any resolution. 
#### 
In the Citra Canary build it follows the **power of 2 rule** which means you can only use textures that are 2x, 4x, 8x and 16x.


# Setup
* Download and install the Citra Canary build from Citra's website here:
####
https://citra-emu.org/download/
### or
* Download and install the Citra PR build with custom texture support by khang06 from here:
#### https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/j53hpvmruwsl5jbf/artifacts/citra-windows-msvc-20190810-dacc1239.7z
### It is best to make a folder called *user* inside the directory where the **citra-qt.exe** is located, and then run it once.  
#### 
That way the config files and what not get populated to the same folder as Citra and not in your Documents or AppData folder. (I forget which folder they go to by default specifically)
* After running Citra once, inside the directory: >user>load>textures>0004000000125***X***00
####
USA = 0004000000125***5***00 
####
EUR = 0004000000125***6***00
* Place the textures from the .zip into this folder.
* Go into graphics options in Citra and make sure you have Use Custom Textures enabled. 
* Done

#### Information
There's a few textures that have different small edits to them, I am merging these changes and making variations of them. Splitting them up by folders, as people may like one style over the other.
