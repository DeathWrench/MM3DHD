# Setup
* Download and install the Citra PR build with custom texture support by khang06 from here:
#### https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/j53hpvmruwsl5jbf/artifacts/citra-windows-msvc-20190810-dacc1239.7z
* It is best to make a folder called user inside the directory where the citra-qt.exe is located, and then run it once.  That way the config files and what not get installed to the same folder as Citra and not in your Documents or AppData folder. (I forget which folder they go to by default specifically specifically)
* After running it once inside the directory >user>load>textures>0004000000125***X***00
* USA = 0004000000125***5***00
* EUR = 0004000000125***6***00
* Place the textures in this folder depending on which region game you are playing.
* Go into graphics options in Citra and make sure you have Use Custom Textures enabled.
